                        mental health
                        companion.
                        Based
                        on
                        information accessed from "Apple Health" and "Google Calendar," Remy is able to help you
                        stay on
                        top
                        of your schedule. Remy gives users suggestions on when to eat, when to sleep, and personally
                        recommends articles on mental health hygiene. All this data is aggregated into a report that
                        can
                        then be sent to medical professionals. Remy also suggests on when to go on walks and
                        provides
                        users
                        the ability to meet other Remy owners.

                        My psychology background inspired me to create an user-friendly mental health service app
                        because I
                        knew
                        that many students lacked awareness of the risks and prevalence of mental health issues. <br>
                        <br>

                        At the Hackathon, Our team connected over our shared passion for social impact our ideas about
                        the
                        effects of loneliness and isolation, including our personal experiences with depression and
                        self-imposed
                        isolation. We looked at our skill sets, shared some personal stories about imaginary friends and
                        distant
                        siblings, and then the idea of Remy was born.

                        Anxiety is the top presenting concern among college students (41.6%), followed by depression
                        (36.4%)
                        and relationship problems (35.8%) (The AUCCCD Annual Survey and Report, 2013).

                        People avoid seeking treatment for these issues so as not to be seen as someone who is
                        “ill.”
                        Accessing treatment is also a problem: the Associated Press reports that many students must
                        wait
                        weeks for treatment or find help outside the campus community as school clinics struggle to
                        meet
                        demand. I wanted to explore a friendly way to help people easily access mental health
                        guidance
                        and
                        find ways to deal with mental health issues using Augmented Reality.

                        encounter problems, they often turn to alcohol and drugs instead of going to clinics and health
                        centers.

                        decided to set up additional goals for this app.
