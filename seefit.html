                            unsure whether we’re exercising our bodies correctly. To solve this problem, our virtual
                            coach will give feedback based its detection of a user’s body movement. If a user moves
                            correctly, the coach will give positive feedback, so that the user gradually learns the
                            correct movements. SeeFit also makes exercise more entertaining by providing auditory and
                            visual inputs based on the user’s body movement. Ultimately, we want to add a multiplayer
                            section that allows interaction among different users, with the movements of each user
                            generating sound, and the sounds combining to create music.

                        I saw people with disabilities going to a service center to move and exercise their bodies. They
                        became more energized and engaged with the exercise as they danced with one another while
                        listening to pop music. We thought we could create a website that teaches users how to exercise,
                        detects their body movements, gives feedback about their movement, and generates sounds
                        corresponding to their movements.

                        countries, disabled people are not often seen in public, because many of them stay in their
                        homes, suffering from social isolation.

                        to track movements. It was our first time using OpenCV, and we ran into many issues with
                        different functions and programs, such as Caffe. We ultimately had to switch to a combination of
                        OpenCV and Tensorflow. This was an arduous process because we had to learn everything from
                        scratch. Fortunately, I have experience with p5js and processing, and also knew how to use
                        Kinect for body tracking. I also found a more recent, simpler version using p5js that can track
                        human body movement without connecting to kinect.

                        We built our platform using an open-source library called Openpose; specifically, we used MLI
                        instead of COCO. We also edited some of the functionality to better fit our purposes. For
                        example, we took out the hand and finger calculations and only focused on the major joints to
                        improve computational speed, since we were mainly focusing on large-scale general body movements
                        during a workout.

                    <div class="cont">
                        Since I learned javascript from my processing course at RISD, I briefly showed the other
                        students the basic command. They quickly were able to figure out tracking point for each body
                        part. For squat, we wrote when ankles are lower than hips, it plays sound.
